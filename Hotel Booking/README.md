##  Objective

To analyze a real-world hotel booking dataset and answer domain-relevant questions through step-by-step data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

##  Approach

The following structured process was followed throughout the notebook:

1. **Understanding the Dataset**
   - Initial overview: shape, column names, null values, data types
   - Brief data description and types of hotels included

2. **Question-Based Exploration**
   - Instead of cleaning everything upfront, we generated specific questions first.
   - For each question:
     - Clean only the **relevant columns**
     - Perform targeted **analysis**
     - Use **visualizations** to present findings clearly

3. **Analysis & Visualization**
   - Plots and summaries were created for each question.
   - Insights were explained clearly below each visualization.
